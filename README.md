# Translator
General idea for this application is open source analog of google's "Translator" app.
Translator application (like google translate). The key factor is: checking the status of the Internet (without it notifying that it does not work and blocking the controls), translating from one language to another, capturing speech and converting it into text, the ability to change the direction of the language (from English to Russian and from Russian to English). Type script.
